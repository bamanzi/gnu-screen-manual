<h1 class="appendix">B. Errors Generated by Make</h1>

<p>Here is a list of the more common errors you might see generated by
<code>make</code>, and some information about what they mean and how to fix
them.
</p>
<p>Sometimes <code>make</code> errors are not fatal, especially in the presence
of a <code>-</code> prefix on a recipe line, or the <code>-k</code> command line
option.  Errors that are fatal are prefixed with the string
<code>***</code>.
</p>
<p>Error messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program
(usually &lsquo;<samp>make</samp>&rsquo;), or, if the error is found in a makefile, the name
of the file and line number containing the problem.
</p>
<p>In the table below, these common prefixes are left off.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>[<var>foo</var>] Error <var>NN</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>[<var>foo</var>] <var>signal description</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>These errors are not really <code>make</code> errors at all.  They mean that a
program that <code>make</code> invoked as part of a recipe returned a
non-0 error code (&lsquo;<samp>Error <var>NN</var></samp>&rsquo;), which <code>make</code> interprets
as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a
signal of some type).  See section <a href="make_59.html#Errors">Errors in Recipes</a>.
</p>
<p>If no <code>***</code> is attached to the message, then the sub-process failed
but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the <code>-</code> special
character, so <code>make</code> ignored the error.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>missing separator.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?).  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means that <code>make</code> could not understand much of anything
about the makefile line it just read.  GNU <code>make</code> looks for
various separators (<code>:</code>, <code>=</code>, recipe prefix characters,
etc.) to indicate what kind of line it&rsquo;s parsing.  This message means
it couldn&rsquo;t find a valid one.
</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or
perhaps your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows
editors) have attempted to indent your recipe lines with spaces
instead of a tab character.  In this case, <code>make</code> will use the
second form of the error above.  Remember that every line in the
recipe must begin with a tab character (unless you set
<code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code>; see section <a href="make_84.html#Special-Variables">Other Special Variables</a>).  Eight spaces do not
count.  See section <a href="make_24.html#Rule-Syntax">Rule Syntax</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>recipe commences before first target.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>missing rule before recipe.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a
recipe: it begins with a recipe prefix character and doesn&rsquo;t appear to
be a legal <code>make</code> directive (such as a variable assignment).
Recipes must always be associated with a target.
</p>
<p>The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first
non-whitespace character; <code>make</code> interprets this to mean you left
out the &quot;target: prerequisite&quot; section of a rule.  See section <a href="make_24.html#Rule-Syntax">Rule Syntax</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>No rule to make target `<var>xxx</var>'.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>No rule to make target `<var>xxx</var>', needed by `<var>yyy</var>'.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means that <code>make</code> decided it needed to build a target, but
then couldn&rsquo;t find any instructions in the makefile on how to do that,
either explicit or implicit (including in the default rules database).
</p>
<p>If you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to your
makefile describing how that target can be built.  Other possible
sources of this problem are typos in the makefile (if that file name is
wrong) or a corrupted source tree (if that file is not supposed to be
built, but rather only a prerequisite).
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>No targets.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The former means that you didn&rsquo;t provide any targets to be built on the
command line, and <code>make</code> couldn&rsquo;t find any makefiles to read in.
The latter means that some makefile was found, but it didn&rsquo;t contain any
default goal and none was given on the command line.  GNU <code>make</code>
has nothing to do in these situations.
See section <a href="make_105.html#Makefile-Arguments">Arguments to Specify the Makefile</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>Makefile `<var>xxx</var>' was not found.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>Included makefile `<var>xxx</var>' was not found.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>A makefile specified on the command line (first form) or included
(second form) was not found.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>warning: overriding recipe for target `<var>xxx</var>'</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>warning: ignoring old recipe for target `<var>xxx</var>'</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>GNU <code>make</code> allows only one recipe to be specified per target
(except for double-colon rules).  If you give a recipe for a target
which already has been defined to have one, this warning is issued and
the second recipe will overwrite the first.  See section <a href="make_42.html#Multiple-Rules">Multiple Rules for One Target</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>Circular <var>xxx</var> &lt;- <var>yyy</var> dependency dropped.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means that <code>make</code> detected a loop in the dependency graph:
after tracing the prerequisite <var>yyy</var> of target <var>xxx</var>, and its
prerequisites, etc., one of them depended on <var>xxx</var> again.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>Recursive variable `<var>xxx</var>' references itself (eventually).  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means you&rsquo;ve defined a normal (recursive) <code>make</code> variable
<var>xxx</var> that, when it&rsquo;s expanded, will refer to itself (<var>xxx</var>).
This is not allowed; either use simply-expanded variables (&lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>::=</samp>&rsquo;) or use the append operator (&lsquo;<samp>+=</samp>&rsquo;).  See section <a href="make_68.html#Using-Variables">How to Use Variables</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>Unterminated variable reference.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means you forgot to provide the proper closing parenthesis
or brace in your variable or function reference.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>insufficient arguments to function `<var>xxx</var>'.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means you haven&rsquo;t provided the requisite number of arguments for
this function.  See the documentation of the function for a description
of its arguments.  See section <a href="make_89.html#Functions">Functions for Transforming Text</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>missing target pattern.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>multiple target patterns.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>mixed implicit and static pattern rules.  Stop.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>These are generated for malformed static pattern rules.  The first
means there&rsquo;s no pattern in the target section of the rule; the second
means there are multiple patterns in the target section; the third
means the target doesn&rsquo;t contain a pattern character (<code>%</code>); and
the fourth means that all three parts of the static pattern rule
contain pattern characters (<code>%</code>)&ndash;only the first two parts
should.  If you see these errors and you aren&rsquo;t trying to create a
static pattern rule, check the value of any variables in your target
and prerequisite lists to be sure they do not contain colons.
See section <a href="make_44.html#Static-Usage">Syntax of Static Pattern Rules</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This warning and the next are generated if <code>make</code> detects error
conditions related to parallel processing on systems where
sub-<code>make</code>s can communicate (see section <a href="make_64.html#Options_002fRecursion">Communicating Options to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>).  This warning is
generated if a recursive invocation of a <code>make</code> process is forced
to have &lsquo;<samp>-j<var>N</var></samp>&rsquo; in its argument list (where <var>N</var> is greater
than one).  This could happen, for example, if you set the <code>MAKE</code>
environment variable to &lsquo;<samp>make -j2</samp>&rsquo;.  In this case, the
sub-<code>make</code> doesn&rsquo;t communicate with other <code>make</code> processes and
will simply pretend it has two jobs of its own.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> &lsquo;<samp>warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>In order for <code>make</code> processes to communicate, the parent will pass
information to the child.  Since this could result in problems if the
child process isn&rsquo;t actually a <code>make</code>, the parent will only do this
if it thinks the child is a <code>make</code>.  The parent uses the normal
algorithms to determine this (see section <a href="make_62.html#MAKE-Variable">How the <code>MAKE</code> Variable Works</a>).  If the makefile is constructed such that the parent
doesn&rsquo;t know the child is a <code>make</code> process, then the child will
receive only part of the information necessary.  In this case, the child
will generate this warning message and proceed with its build in a
sequential manner.
