This is make.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.1 from make.texi.

This file documents the GNU 'make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and
issues the commands to recompile them.

   This is Edition 0.73, last updated 5 October 2014, of 'The GNU Make
Manual', for GNU 'make' version 4.1.
